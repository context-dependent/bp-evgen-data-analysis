# What is a Data Analysis Project?

- A **DAP** is a Blueprint Project that includes programmatic data analysis. For clarity's sake, if a project includes programmatic data anlaysis, it (the whole project) is a **DAP**.
- This definition is carefully specified to ensure that the overarching project and its data analysis elements are not siloed or separated, though this document, and indeed this repository, focus on detailing the aspects of a **DAP** where those aspects relate to the analysis of data. Other pieces of projects will be referred to abstractly.
- Over the course of a **DAP**, its **TEAM** of one or more Data Analysts plan and perform **ANALYSIS WORK** using **INPUT DATASETS** guided by **PROJECT OBJECTIVES** to produce **ANALYSIS OUTPUTS** as contributions to **PROJECT DELIVERABLES**.
- **ANALYSIS PLANNING** is typically concentrated in the earlier parts of the **DAP**, while **ANALYSIS WORK** is typically concentrated closer to the end, though there are often interim reporting objectives.

# Component Definitions

## DAP

A DAP can be one of:

- Program Evaluation
- Population Research
- Policy Analysis

## TEAM

- Engagement Lead: The EL assigned to the **DAP**
- Data Analyst: The contributor assigned to carry out the **ANALYSIS WORK**
- Peer Reviewer: A contributor external to the **TEAM**, but roughly equivalent in title to the Data Analyst assigned to help test code and assumptions, troubleshoot, share resources, and problem solve.
- Senior Analysis Support: Backstop for peer reviewer.

## ANALYSIS PLANNING

- AP 0 (Pre-Contract): Some version of an analysis plan is often included in proposals for new projects.
- AP I (Pre-Data): **ANALYSIS PLANNING** begins early in the course of the **DAP**.
  - for Program Evaluation, it develops in tandem with the Evaluation Plan and the design of data collection tools
  - for Population Research, it is symbiotic with survey design and data collection strategy
  - for Policy Analysis, AP I drives the development and negotiation of data requests of data requests.
- AP II (Post-Data): This version of the **AP** is built iteratively, after **INPUT DATASETS** have been assembled.
  A. Exploration => B.
  B. Discussion => C.
  C. Reconcilliation => D.
  D. Ideation => A.

## INPUT DATASETS

Are the unmodified results of data collection or client data sharing. An input dataset is one of:

- Blueprint Survey
- Administrative
- StatCan Survey (PUMF)
- External Data (inc RDC, ESDC, etc.)
