# What is a Data Analysis Project?

- A **DAP** is a Blueprint Project that includes programmatic data analysis. For clarity's sake, if a project includes programmatic data anlaysis, it (the whole project) is a **DAP**.
- This definition is carefully specified to ensure that the overarching project and its data analysis elements are not siloed or separated, though this document, and indeed this repository, focus on detailing the aspects of a **DAP** where those aspects relate to the analysis of data. Other pieces of projects will be referred to abstractly.
- Over the course of a **DAP**, its **TEAM** of one or more Data Analysts plan and perform **ANALYSIS WORK** using **INPUT DATASETS** guided by **PROJECT OBJECTIVES** to produce **ANALYSIS OUTPUTS** as contributions to **PROJECT DELIVERABLES**.
- **ANALYSIS PLANNING** is typically concentrated in the earlier parts of the **DAP**, while **ANALYSIS WORK** is typically concentrated closer to the end, though there are often interim reporting objectives.
- **INPUT DATASETS** are held in **SECURE STORAGE**, while the **ANALYSIS REPOSITORY** hosts the code that is used to carry out the **ANALYSIS WORK**


# Component Definitions

## DAP

A DAP can be one of:

- Program Evaluation
- Population Research
- Policy Analysis

## TEAM

- Engagement Lead: The EL assigned to the **DAP**
- Data Analyst: The contributor assigned to carry out the **ANALYSIS WORK**
- Peer Reviewer: A contributor external to the **TEAM**, but roughly equivalent in title to the Data Analyst assigned to help test code and assumptions, troubleshoot, share resources, and problem solve.
- Senior Analysis Support: Backstop for peer reviewer.

## ANALYSIS PLANNING

- AP 0 (Pre-Contract): Some version of an analysis plan is often included in proposals for new projects.
- AP I (Pre-Data): **ANALYSIS PLANNING** begins early in the course of the **DAP**.
  - for Program Evaluation, it develops in tandem with the Evaluation Plan and the design of data collection tools
  - for Population Research, it is symbiotic with survey design and data collection strategy
  - for Policy Analysis, AP I drives the development and negotiation of data requests of data requests.
  - in virtually every case, AP I represents revisions of AP 0. Maintaining a living understanding of these revisions by way of persistent documentation is critical.
- AP II (Post-Data): This version of the **AP** is built iteratively, after **INPUT DATASETS** have been assembled. Ultimately, it reconciles the updated project objectives with the approach and outputs of the **ANALYSIS WORK**
  A. Exploration => B.
  B. Discussion => C.
  C. Reconcilliation => D.
  D. Ideation => A.
- AP III (Output): This version follows the execution of AP II, adding a list of outputs, specified to whatever extent possible, that the primary analyst will work to produce.

## INPUT DATASETS

Are the unmodified results of data collection or client data sharing. An input dataset is one of:

- Blueprint Survey
- Administrative
- StatCan Survey (PUMF)
- External Data (inc RDC, ESDC, etc.)

Input datasets are documented in the **DAP**'s **DATA DICTIONARY**.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES

Are the objectives of the **DAP** as a whole. Keeping these current (as they bend and break with new information and new requests), and visible (to everyone on the project) is key to avoiding unnecessary work, ensuring alignment, and mitigating the risk of aimless spiraling.

## ANALYSIS OUTPUTS

Are the tables, figures, and occasionaly other tools rendered by the primary analyst for inclusion in **PROJECT DELIVERABLES**. Each output should be accompanied by notes clarifying its intention, interpretation, and limitations.

## ANALYSIS WORK

## PROJECT DELIVERABLES

## DATA DICTIONARY

## ANALYSIS REPOSITORY

## SECURE STORAGE

## DATA PIPELINE

## EXAMPLE DATA

## On "Data Cleaning", so-called

"Data Cleaning" is a phrase used to describe the process of generating a package of analysis-ready research datasets. In the **DAP** concept articulated here, it is intentionally situated within **ANALYSIS WORK**. Contrary to the characterization endemic in our organization, data cleaning is inseparable from the other aspects of analysis. The 'dirty' data doesn't know how to clean itself.

A more apt term may be data sculpting, as the crux of the task is to understand what information is important, what information is disposable, where the inputs came from and how they formed.
