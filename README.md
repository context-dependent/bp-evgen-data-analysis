# EvGen Data Analysis Procedures

This repository has been created with the optimistic intent of ultimately answering the following questions: 

- What is an "Evidence Generation Data Analysis Project"? 
- How do we work together on such projects? 
- How do we ensure quality and responsiveness? 
- How do we codify lessons learned to build collective intelligence? 
- How do we use collective intelligence to increase efficiency and quality? 

Out of chaos and confusion, the team working on this hopes to build some of the key foundations of answers to these questions.
