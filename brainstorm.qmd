## Participant Pathways

- A participant pathway is a chain of events that a participant experiences.
- It begins at the start of their involvement with the program, and ends at the conclusion of the follow-up period.
- Each pathway is made up of Milestones, events that we care about, which have some decisive affect on the course of a given participant's pathway.
- Care should be taken at the outset of an evaluation project to clearly and specifically define the universe of pathways we want to investigate.

### An example

Consider a hypothetical program called FairWeather, which offers an on-ramp to a career in the green energy manufacuring industry to NEET youth under 30 in three stages.
FairWeather is delivered by a non-profit service provider called CanWork.
CanWork maintains relationships with industry professionals in various roles who have volunteered to work with participants in the Job Shadowing aspects of the program.

Each of the volunteers has one of the following roles:

- Millwright
- Assembly line worker
- Industrial designer
- Manager

1. Career Exploration: In the first -- and only mandatory -- stage of the FairWeather program, participants spend three weeks in a classroom setting learning about themselves, the green energy manufacturing labour market, and the opportunities that may be a good fit for them.
2. Job Shadowing: In the second phase, participants select the two roles (from the four volunteer role categories) in which they have the most interest as potential careers.
For each of their selections, they are assigned a volunteer with that role, whom they spend two weeks shadowing.
3. Coaching and Mentoring: Following the job shadowing stage, participants are given the opportunity to discuss their experience with a career coach, with whom they collaboratively develop a plan to establish the participant in their career of interest.
The participant's progress on that plan is monitored by the Coach, who remains in contact and available to the participant.
